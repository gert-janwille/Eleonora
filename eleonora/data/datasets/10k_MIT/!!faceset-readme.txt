This is a natural, unbiased set of 10,168 face photographs based on the 1990 US population. To generate this database, first and last names were separately and randomly sampled from the 1990 US Census. First and last names were randomly paired (so that these are not real names) and used as queries to automatically download face images from Google Images. The resulting database follows a distribution of faces similar to the US population in terms of gender, race, and age. The database also has variability in attractiveness, image quality, angle of face, emotional expression, and several other features.

This database DOES NOT include faces of minors, people with glasses, unusual makeup, obvious deformities, and we have minimized celebrities. All face photographs show both eyes. Images have a resolution of at least 72 pixels/inch, and have been cropped with an oval around the face to minimize background effects and resized to a height of 256 pixels with variable width. Query names do not necessarily correspond to the name of the person in the image.

The corresponding file name of the image is the name used to query the image (so the original image may often be found by searching for the name in the file name on Google Images). Multiple images (approximately 20) were downloaded per name, so the number after the name indicates which number photo it was.
